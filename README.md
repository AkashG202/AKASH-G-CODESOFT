This repository have results of task given by CODSOFT during Internship

Task : 1 - Titanic Survival Prediction Project

In this project, I build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The dataset contains key features such as age, gender, 
ticket class, fare, and cabin information. Using this data, we apply classification techniques like logistic regression or decision trees to analyze patterns and predict 
survival outcomes. The project emphasizes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model evaluation. It serves as an excellent beginner 
project for understanding the fundamentals of machine learning and data science.

Task : 2 - Movie Rating Prediction Project

In this project, I develop a machine learning model to predict movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors. Using regression techniques, the model 
analyzes historical movie data to estimate ratings provided by users or critics. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building, 
offering insights into the key factors influencing movie ratings. It is an excellent exercise for exploring data analysis and machine learning techniques while 
understanding how different elements contribute to a movieâ€™s success or reception.
